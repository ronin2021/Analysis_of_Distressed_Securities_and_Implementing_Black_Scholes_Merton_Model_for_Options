    *   Hospitality Stocks: Hilton, Marriott

## Breakdown of Tasks

    1)  Create and clean price data within google sheets using the google finance function; convert spreadsheets into CSV files. 
    2)  Read CSV files into Python and create individual Pandas dataframes for each stock. 
    3)  Create new Pandas dataframes for each stock showing daily returns using the pct_change function. 
    4)  Visualize performance of stocks compared to the S&P 500 over the three year window. 
    5)  Calculate beta for each stock before, during, and after the pandemic. 
    5)  Concatenate daily returns dataframes into one dataframe; visualize the performance of all stocks on one graph. 
    6)  Calculate the risk to reward ratio for each stock and identify the smartest stock to invest in over the 3 year period.
    7)  Run monte carlo simulations to predict future stock performance.
