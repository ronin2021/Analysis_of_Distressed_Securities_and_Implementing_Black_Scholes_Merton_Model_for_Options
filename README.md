# Sector Analysis Project

## Team: Matthew Willson, Indrajith Senevirathne, Nicholas DePalma, Jamel Harvey 

## Project Description: 

Sector analysis of airline, hospitality, cruiseship, and restaurant stocks before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Determine and visualize which stocks performed best throughout the period 1/1/18 to 6/30/21. 

    *   Airline Stocks: Delta, American Airlines
    *   Hospitality Stocks: Hilton, Marriott
    *   Cruiseship Stocks: Carnival, Royal Caribbean 
    *   Restaurant Stocks: Dine Brands Global, Mcdonalds

## Proposal:

Compare the effects of Covid-19 on the value of airline, hospitality, cruiseship, and restaurant stocks. Performance will be measured against the S&P 500. 

## Research Questions to be Answered:

    * How large was the impact of the pandemic on each sector?(Airlines, Hospitality, Cruiseship, and Restaurant)
    * What sector performed the best/worst throughout the pandemic?
    * How did each sector perform compared to the S&P 500?

## Datasets 

    * Daily closing prices of each stock from January 2018 to June 2021.

## Breakdown of Tasks

    1)  Create and clean price data within google sheets using the google finance function; convert spreadsheets into CSV files. 
    2)  Read CSV files into Python and create individual Pandas dataframes for each stock. 
    3)  Create new Pandas dataframes for each stock showing daily returns using the pct_change function. 
    4)  Visualize performance of stocks compared to the S&P 500 over the three year window. 
    5)  Calculate beta for each stock before, during, and after the pandemic. 
    5)  Concatenate daily returns dataframes into one dataframe; visualize the performance of all stocks on one graph. 
    6)  Calculate the risk to reward ratio for each stock and identify the smartest stock to invest in over the 3 year period.
    7)  Run monte carlo simulations to predict future stock performance.
